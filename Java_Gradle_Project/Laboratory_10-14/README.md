## Assignment 1: Model Classes, Validators, Repository Interface, Exception Handling

In this assignment, I have implemented model classes, validators, and repository interface for managing ticket sales. Additionally, I have included specific exceptions for validation errors.

### Model Classes:
1. `Angajat`: Represents an employee involved in ticket sales.
2. `Bilet`: Represents a ticket.
3. `Spectacol`: Represents a show or performance.
#### Validators
Validators for Angajat, Spectacol.
#### Repository Interface
General repository inferface.
#### Exception Handling
A custom exception is implemented to handle validation errors. This ensures that any validation issues are caught and dealt with appropriately.


## Assignment 2: implementing repository classes to connect to database and added journalizing.
