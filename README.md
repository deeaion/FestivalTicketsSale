# Multi-Language Client-Server Application

## Introduction
This project is still on going. It is made during the "Systems for Design and Implementation" course.
I had to create a simple Festival Ticket sale Application both in Java and C#.


## About Project
In both C# and Java , the application can be run with a server-client application through Object protocol in C#, and 
Json Protocol in Java.
Also the projects can be used as server and client, server being the C# implementation and client the Java implementation through ProtoBuff Communication!
## Technologies Used
- **Java/JavaFX**: For the java interface.
- **C# with Windows Forms**: For the C# interface.
- **protobuff**: For client-server communication.
- **Protocol Buffers**: For data serialization.
- **Hibernate**: For ORM in Java.

## Features
- **Interactive GUIs** in both Java and C#.
- **protobuf communication** allows seamless interaction between Java and C# applications.
- **Hibernate integration** on the Java side for handling database operations.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve error handling and add more robust connection management.
- Extend the database functionality with more complex entity relationships.
- Add web interface comunication with Java.
- Add spring to the project.
- Rest communication.
